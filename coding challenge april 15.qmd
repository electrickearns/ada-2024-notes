```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library (lme4)

```

```{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/Bowden-ParryOtterdata.csv"
d <- read_csv (f, col_names = TRUE)

#wrangle
## adding trial variable
d <- d %>% mutate(trial= paste0(zoo, trialorder))

##addding in an observation-level column. Use as a random effect to give each row a unique identifier
d <- rowid_to_column(d, var="obs")

## rename 
d <- d %>% rename(Shared= TotalSharebothharasspro, BegRec = begreceived)

## plot total food transferred in relation to begging received
ggplot(d, aes(x = BegRec, y=Shared)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  xlab("Begging Received (total")
```

Then he kept going without ME\

at some point did: Shared \~ BegRec + offset (log(trialduration/60))\

```{r}
m <- glmer (Shared ~ BegRec + offset(log(trialduration/60)) + (1|ID) + (1|trial) + (1|obs), data=d, family= poisson (link=log))

summary (m)
```
