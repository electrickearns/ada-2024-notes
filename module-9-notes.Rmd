# Load in library of data, load tidyverse, and create d and f.

```{r}
library (tidyverse)
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/Country-Data-2016.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
names(d)
```

# summarize data. how many variables, how many observations.
```{r}
summary(d)
nrow (d)
ncol(d)
names(d)
```


# Median population size and area for each country	
```{r}
median(d$area, na.rm=TRUE)
median(d$population, na.rm=TRUE)
```


# create a new density variable in data frame for density and identify the 10 most dense and least dense.
```{r}
d$density <- d$population/d$area
order (d$density, decreasing = TRUE)
d[1:10]
```
#unfortunately, you couldn't get this code to work, but I have to go teach and we're working on diplyr stuff we haven't covered instead of this.
